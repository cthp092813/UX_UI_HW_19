                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Vietnamese American UX/UI designer interested in working in the gaming industry.<br><br> I previously worked as a registered nurse (RN) for a year, and while I loved taking care of others, it didn't quite satisfy my creative self. During my career transition, I ventured to learn more about the tech industry and briefly learned about HTML and CSS from Codeacademy for Full Web Development. I then stumbled upon UX/UI design when taking a career test, signed up for a University of Denver's UX/UI Design Bootcamp, and I have fallen in love with it ever since! <br><br> What I love about design is that it does not have a "correct" or "right" answer. I get to synthesize a multitude of solutions, both terrible and maybe even genius, and test them. I love building rapport with clients and view them as part of the team to enhance the user experience for the product.</p>

                    <h4>User Research</h4>

                    <p>To display users/stakeholders needs, I create a user persona, empathy map, and/or a user journey map, so others are able to understand their thought processes and pain points. Their needs become my main focus throughout the project.</p>
